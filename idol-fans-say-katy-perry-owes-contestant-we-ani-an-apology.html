First of all, shook by the results, and I’m also shook by that song is so dramatic.”</p><p>“There’s so much drama going through my body right now I need a nap,” continued Perry. “But the truth is, America, you guys have the votes. You’re the ones voting and if you’re not voting, you’re not using your voice. Your faves aren’t safe. So from now on, vote for who you want to see in the Top 12.”</p><p>Once again, “Idol” fans were not happy with Perry, calling out her lack of feedback for Ani.</p><p>“Katy Perry needs to apologize to We Ani immediately! So dismissive because she didn’t get her choice,” one person <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “It’s called ‘American Idol’ for a reason it’s America’s choice not yours!”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Perry, 38, and the other judges were thrown for a loop during Sunday’s three-hour episode after voters failed to push McCormick, 21, through to the Top 20. <span class=credit>American Idol/ABC</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Wé Ani <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">performed a haunting version</a> of Adele’s “Skyfall” and survived elimination. <span class=credit>ABC via Getty Images</span></figure><p>“Sorry non #AmericanIdol watchers, but here I go again,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">someone else added</a>. “@katyperry just backhand insulted the last contestant to get through, We Ani.

Fans <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">accused Perry of “mom shaming”</a>&nbsp;her into eventually quitting the show.</p><p>Liebe initially shocked the judges by saying that she was a mom when asked if singing was her “dream.”</p><p>“Look, if it’s not your dream, it’s not gonna go far because I also respect everyone that’s walking through that door who will lay down their life for this golden ticket [to Hollywood],” Perry added about other hopefuls advancing to the next round of competition.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">McCormick (left) was eliminated alongside five others. <span class=credit>American Idol/ABC</span></figure><p>Liebe later headed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a>&nbsp;to say it was “embarrassing to have that on TV,” while also adding: “I think that mom-shaming’s super lame.”</p><p>Eventually, she quit the show after saying it “was not a ploy” because she sincerely missed being with her kids. She also issued a statement on Instagram saying that she was “not even mad” about Perry’s comments.</p><p>“If you watch my videos, you’d know that I’m not even mad. I’m just trying to do music,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stated the mom of three</a>. “I’m so over it, No more.”</p><p>The “Dark Horse” singer was also <a href=#>booed during last week’s show</a> after she critiqued one of the contestant’s outfits. And a few weeks ago, Perry was slammed for <a href=#>waging “psychological warfare”</a> on two contestants after making them believe that they were being sent home.</p><p>It’s not the first time the singing competition was slammed for its judges’ seemingly harsh comments.</p><p>Original “American Idol” judge&nbsp;<a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>, 63, was legendary for&nbsp;<a href=#>giving harsh advice</a>, sometimes even upsetting fellow judges Randy Jackson, 66, and Paula Abdul, 60, in the OG run of the show from 2002 to 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21ma2xfnrGwuIyfmKerXaiuunnKmquyZaCav7PFjKiunqtdmLyvwMSsq5qmpGLEpnnAp6BmmZ5irrG7y6iesmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fidol-fans-say-katy-perry-owes-contestant-we-ani-an-apology.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fidol-fans-say-katy-perry-owes-contestant-we-ani-an-apology.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fidol-fans-say-katy-perry-owes-contestant-we-ani-an-apology.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fidol-fans-say-katy-perry-owes-contestant-we-ani-an-apology.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fidol-fans-say-katy-perry-owes-contestant-we-ani-an-apology.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fidol-fans-say-katy-perry-owes-contestant-we-ani-an-apology.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./724819-adam-lazzara-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./724819-adam-lazzara-net-worth.html>Adam Lazzara Net Worth 2023: What Is The Taking Back Sunday Star Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-is-my-frizzle-sizzle-turning-brown-html.html>Why is my Frizzle Sizzle turning brown?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-is-my-frizzle-sizzle-turning-brown-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

However, his journey to fame began in Englewood, a suburb neighborhood of the South Side of Chicago, infamously referred to as the murder capital.</p><p>The city, though infamous, has also produced other prominent figures in the music industry, including Jennifer Hudson, Lil Reese, Famous Dex, Mavis Staples, and Fredo Santana. Durk was born on the 19th of October 1992, and his birth name was Durk Banks.</p><p>From childhood, he was exposed to the realities of life in the crime-infested city. His father, Dontay Banks, Sr., was incarcerated when Durk was only 7. He was raised along with his siblings; 3 sisters and a brother named Dontay Banks Jr. (a.k.a D’thang), by their mother, who is a nurse.</p><p>Durk joined a gang, the Black Disciples alongside his brother, who was also a rapper. Unfortunately, Dontay Jr. was killed in a gang operation in 2011. His father, whom he referred to as Big Durk, was released from prison in February 2019 after 25 years.</p><p>When he was very young, Durk didn’t have the privilege of a father to provide for him. As a result, he found himself having to meet many family needs that are way bigger than him.</p><p>While it was a hard time for him, he admitted that it has helped him to weigh his every action and decision, especially since he started having kids of his own. Notably, Lil Durk had his first child at 18.</p><p>Although he had already spent some time behind bars for gun-related offenses, he said he doesn’t want his kids to go through what he went through. Hence, Lil Durk would avoid anything that will take him away from his little ones. He also wants his children to have all those moments he missed.</p><p>Following the birth of his child, Durk dropped out of school to support his young one. That was about the same period he began his music career in 2011. His music career kicked off with his affiliation with another Chicago rapper, Chief Keef’s label, formerly known as Glory Boyz Entertainment.</p><p>Though he has been around the scene for a while, Lil Durk’s career only started receiving public acclaim with the release of his hit singles, Sneak Dissing,&nbsp;and I’ ma Hitta,&nbsp;which went a long way to place him on the musical map.</p><p>Durk has also credited social media platforms like MySpace and YouTube with launching him into prominence. The rapid increase of his fan base encouraged him to do more.</p><p>He released a mixtape, Life ain’t no joke in 2012, and his follow-up single Dis Aint What You Want was rewarded with the joint venture deal with his record label OTF and Def Jam Recordings. His debut studio album, Remember My Name came in 2015, and it peaked at number 14 on the Billboard 200.</p><p>Lil Durk’s discography includes four studio albums, twelve mixtapes, two compilation albums, and twelve singles. With an estimated net worth of $3 million and a growing music career, Durk can confidently cater to the needs of his kids, while enjoying the moments with them as he continues to stay out of crime’s way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC4yKVkna2ioHqjtc5mmZqaqWK6ornAaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flil-durk-bio-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flil-durk-bio-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flil-durk-bio-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flil-durk-bio-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flil-durk-bio-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flil-durk-bio-baby-mama.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amy-ferson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amy-ferson.html>Amy Ferson - Bio, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Married, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-karol-g-net-worth.html>Who is Karol G and what is her net worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-karol-g-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

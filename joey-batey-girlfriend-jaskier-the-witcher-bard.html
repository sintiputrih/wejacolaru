Fans want to know if the actor/singer is dating a girlfriend and we have got some details for you.</strong></p><p>Well renowned as Jaskier from the hit Netflix show The Witcher, <strong>Joey Batey</strong> is a British actor and also a musician; vocalist, and frontman of an indie band named The Amazing Devil. Batey has been successful in making a name for himself through his role in The Witcher, singing the tune for Geralt of Rivia. An incredibly talented actor who hustled all the way and found the best role that suits his persona, Joey won the hearts of many. Now many are interested to know more about the actor, especially about his girlfriend.</p><p>Born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1989, Joey Batey grew up in a "musical family" and has always been around music. He co-wrote and performed the sketch show Good Clean Men with <strong>Alex Owen</strong> and <strong>Ben Ashenden</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>The Pin</strong>). After a few weeks at L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq, he dropped out. Thus never actually been officially a trained actor.</p><p>In 2013, Batey made his film debut in <strong>Geoffrey Sax</strong>'s British thriller Murder on the Home Front. Following 2014, he starred in <strong>Lone Scherfig</strong>'s film The Riot Club. Later in 2017, he was cast as Eddie in <strong>Paul McGuigan</strong>'s film Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool. Batey has also been in the British television shows C.B. Strike (2017), In The Dark (2017), and Knightfall (2017). Starring in The Witcher was a triumph for the actor. As curiosity around knowing more about the actor's love life built up, here's everything we know about Joey Batey's girlfriend.</p><h2>Joey Batey Girlfriend: Dating Details of the Jaskier Actor</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2021/12/joey-batey-girlfriend-madeleine-hyland.jpg alt=joey-batey-girlfriend-madeleine-hyland width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Joey Batey stirred girlfriend rumors with Madeleine Hyland but they are friends and bandmates.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Joey Batey Instagram</a></strong></p><p>Innocent face, cute smile, and talking eyes, Joey Batey is the current heartthrob. Making many interested and invested in his love life, the topic of Joey Batey Girlfriend is the hot take now.</p><p>Looking through the actor's socials and digging deep, Joey Batey is just as mysterious as he looks. Completely lost in his art and music, Batey shares very little of his life on his Instagram. But could he be leaving hints here and there about his girlfriend?</p><h3>Could Joey Batey be Dating His Bandmate Madeleine Hyland?</h3><p>Since very little of Joey Batey is known, many rumors and speculations have been flying around surrounding his love life and his girlfriend. While some think he is dating his co-star Anya Chalotra, others think he might be dating his bandmate, <strong>Madeleine Hyland</strong>.</p><p>Joey posted a picture with Anya for the first time in 2019. Dated 9th November of 2019, the actor posted a <a href=# rel=noopener>picture</a> of himself with Anya with the caption, "Getting ready for the oncoming&nbsp;<a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=# rel=noopener>@witchernetflix</a>&nbsp;storm. With pudding. And&nbsp;<a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=# rel=noopener>@anyachalotra</a> ... ‘Eternity is hidden in every moment...’ Steel yourselves, wolves. <a class=xil3i tabindex=0 href=# rel=noopener># December 20th.</a>" The closeness and affection between the pair made many wonder if they are something more than friends. However, Anya Chalotra is speculated to be someone else's girlfriend.</p><p>Another person seen on Joey Batey's Instagram is his bandmate, Madeleine Hyland. The pair's recent<a href=# rel=noopener> picture</a> created quite the buzz on the internet. The seductiveness and mystery portrayed in the picture, made many questions if they have something going on or are they just friends. However, the post was about the band and how he struggled to make his new album Ruin, also expressing gratitude to people who helped him reach the heights. The one-time relationship speculation just died away leaving no evidence behind.</p><p>Thus, Joey Batey could actually be single or he could be hiding information about his girlfriend. The actor seems to be very much career-focused. Similar to his fellow co-star <a href=#>Freya Allan, who also scarcely divulges boyfriend details</a>, Joey is focused on building on his new found fame.</p><h2>The Witcher Season 2 Sees Jaskier Bringing Two New Songs</h2><p></p><p>Few would have predicted that one of the most memorable moments from season one of <a href=#><strong>The Witcher</strong></a>, which premiered on Netflix in 2019, would be the absolute banger of a song strummed by humble bard Jaskier played by Joey Batey in the second episode, rather than the special effects, fight choreography, or even <strong>Henry Cavill</strong>'s central performance. Toss a Coin to Your Witcher's viral success surprised Batey and the song's creators; composers <strong>Giona Ostinelli</strong> and<strong> Sonya Belousova</strong>, as well as lyricist <strong>Jenny Klein</strong>.</p><p>Coming with another banger in season 2, released on <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> on December 19, Batey followed up the season with the grittier Burn Butcher, Burn, performed in Episode 4. Jaskier's song is darker in tone than his previous, focusing on how he felt after his last encounter with Geralt of Rivia, in which the Witcher and bard parted ways on poor terms.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>When asked how did he compose Burn Butcher, Burn,&nbsp;Batey explains, "The main thing that we wanted to do coming into Season 2 was explore Jaskier's discography and his musicality, and how he can shift and change and develop his own musical style," in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Newsweek</a>. He further added he wanted Jaskier to "step away from perhaps the poppier, catchy tunes and no longer rely on the stories of others to translate into the songs but rather explore his own stories and his own."</p><p>Will the song be a hit like his first Toss a Coin to Your Witcher, or will it be just another tune playing in the world-famous series? The Witcher season 2 is currently streaming on Netflix. The cast of the series is led by <strong>Henry Cavill</strong> as Geralt of Rivia,&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Anya Chalotra</a>&nbsp;</strong>as <a href=#><strong>Yennefer</strong></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Freya Allan</a>&nbsp;</strong>as&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Ciri</a></strong>.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-170 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=#><strong>Get to Know</strong></a> your favorite celebrities and <a href=#><strong>Explore</strong></a> relationship details of <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> stars with <a href=#><strong>Celebs In-depth</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGihqJ2pYq%2BiwMSyZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmopGouKqx0WaroZ1drLa1r8eeqWaakaexcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoey-batey-girlfriend-jaskier-the-witcher-bard.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoey-batey-girlfriend-jaskier-the-witcher-bard.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoey-batey-girlfriend-jaskier-the-witcher-bard.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoey-batey-girlfriend-jaskier-the-witcher-bard.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoey-batey-girlfriend-jaskier-the-witcher-bard.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoey-batey-girlfriend-jaskier-the-witcher-bard.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./minnie-ida-anderson-maya-rudolph-daughter-paul-thomas-anderson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./minnie-ida-anderson-maya-rudolph-daughter-paul-thomas-anderson.html>Meet Minnie Ida Anderson Photos Of Maya Rudolphs Daughter With Partner Paul Thomas Anderson</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./james-mee.html>James Mee - photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./james-mee.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

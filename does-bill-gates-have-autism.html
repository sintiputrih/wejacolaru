Challenges for people with Asperger’s include hypersensitivity to sensory experiences, difficulty with conversation and nonverbal cues, clumsiness, anxiety, and depression. Strengths, meanwhile, include remarkable focus and persistence, aptitude for pattern recognition, and attention to detail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaJyfmsBursilo2afkamytHnHmq2eZZGqwaq%2FzGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./juan-archuleta-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./juan-archuleta-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html>Juan Archuleta Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./andrew-garfield-jokes-about-the-amazing-spider-man-2-rhino-fight.html>Andrew Garfield jokes about The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Rhino fight</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./andrew-garfield-jokes-about-the-amazing-spider-man-2-rhino-fight.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

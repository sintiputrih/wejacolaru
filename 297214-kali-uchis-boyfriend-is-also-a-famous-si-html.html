More surprisingly, there were some indications that the relationship might have started as early as 2020.</p><p class=dh>This was no flash in the pan, and fans wondered how two artists with such different music styles and personalities got together. Uchis and Toliver start out by proving they can make beautiful music together, but they keep their romance so discreet as to be almost a secret.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/85bb94a99caf0348179560c46ed14f82.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Don Toliver and Kali Uchis at the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awardson April 03, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6641674/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">Kali Uchis</a> was born Karly Marina Loaiza in Alexandria, Virginia, on July 17, 1994.

Leonard was the first boxer to earn more than $100 million in purses. He is revered as one of the greatest boxers of all time, having won titles in five different weight divisions. He is particularly famed for his notable matches with professional boxers such as Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns, Roberto Duran, and Wilfred Benitez.</p><h3>Summary of Sugar Ray Leonard’s Net Worth</h3><p>Born on May 17, 1956, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, Ray Charles Leonard commenced his amateur boxing career at the age of 14. This propelled his popularity and net worth to soar. Leonard’s decision to pursue a professional boxing career earned him the nickname “Sugar Ray,” after the legendary boxer Sugar Ray Robinson. His professional debut was in 1977 at the Civic Center in Baltimore, Maryland. By November 30, 1979, he had already secured the WBC Welterweight Championship when he fought Wilfred Benitez, marking the beginning of the rise of Sugar Ray Leonard’s net worth. On March 28, 1981, he defended his world title against Larry Bonds, further solidifying his financial success.</p><p>Retiring in 1997 after a challenging loss to Hector “Macho” Camacho, Leonard’s boxing career was marked by several accolades, including being named “Fighter of the Year” and “Sportsman of the Year” by notable sporting organizations. Leonard achieved a career record of 36-3-1 with 25 knockouts.</p><p>Following his retirement, he transitioned into a commentator role for various renowned networks. This additional endeavor contributed to the growth of Sugar Ray Leonard’s net worth. He also ventured into endorsements with well-known companies such as Ford, Coca-Cola, EA Sports, and Nabisco. Additionally, he made occasional appearances in movies and reality shows.</p><p>Despite ending his boxing career, Leonard continues to be a prominent figure in the sports industry, with an estimated net worth of over $100 million. He is also known for his philanthropic efforts, supporting the “Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.” The foundation expanded in 2009 to support healthcare services, job training, and accessible housing. His community involvement was acknowledged with an award from the LA Sports & Entertainment Commission in 2007.</p><p>Married to Robi since 2003, Leonard resides in a luxurious $8.7 million estate in Pacific Palisades, California, with their two children, Daniel Ray and Camille. Notably, he serves as the godfather of Khloe Kardashian, a prominent figure in the reality show “Keeping Up With The Kardashians.”</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Sugar Ray Leonard</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$120 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 17, 1956</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Rocky Mount, North Carolina</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.78 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>72 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Professional Boxer, Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Bernadette Robi (m. 1993), Juanita Wilkinson (m. 1980–1990)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Jarrel Leonard, Ray Charles Leonard, Jr., Daniel Ray Leonard, Camille Leonard</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Ray Charles Leonard , Ray C.

It immerses you in a different world. I couldn’t fathom anything better at that time.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Sugar Ray Leonard is more reserved, kind of quiet. He’s not as outgoing as Sugar Ray Leonard. Sugar Ray Leonard was very determined, very focused, very outgoing, and very selfish, if you will. There are two distinct personas.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I would search through trash cans when I was extremely hungry. If I found half a sandwich, I would consume it. It was purely about survival. I didn’t think much of it, but that was just the way things were.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Before fights, I would run alone. It was my time to choreograph the fight in my mind, so I needed to be alone.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>People attempt to live vicariously through fighters, but it’s one-on-one; it’s primal. There’s no other feeling like it. The challenge for me was accepting that nothing compares to becoming a champion.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I’m tremendously optimistic. I always believed that there’s another shot, another chance. In boxing, I never gave up. Even when things seemed bleak, I persisted in pushing forward to turn things in my favor.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>The ring was my light during times of darkness. It was the one place I felt safe. I could control what happened in the ring. It made my heart harden.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>The time to stop is when the other guy hits you more than you hit him.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>We’re all given some sort of skill in life. Mine just happens to be beating up on people.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>No one but myself thought I could beat guys like Tommy Hearns or Roberto Duran.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>I wanted to win the gold medal and then go home to further my education in college. I had no intentions to become a professional fighter because I had heard about former boxers who made money but ultimately ended up with nothing. I didn’t want to be one of those individuals.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>When I’m not in training, I’ll walk around at 153 pounds, but it’s not solid; it’s my casual weight.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>It’s challenging to talk about yourself.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>I’d think, “If this is his first punch, how will the others feel?” That’s the only fear I have for myself.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>I’ve done numerous things in my life that I’m not proud of.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>I’m not religious, but I believe that what I have is a gift, and I respect it and live up to it.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>I wouldn’t change anything because the mistakes and the hurt are as significant as all the great fights. They shaped who I am today.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>I enjoy the school run and being a dad. Boxing will always be with me. I like that.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>I vividly remember all the important fights and details.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>If I hadn’t had the talent, the networks wouldn’t have televised my fights. No one has made me; I made myself. I paid my dues.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>I aspired to be like Bruce Jenner.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>In Italy, I had an Afro, and a lot of the kids came up and felt my hair. It really was amusing. I wish I had understood Italian.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>I believe I’ve become one of the best finishers in boxing; if I hurt a guy, I usually take him out.</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>I always designed my robes and how I would present myself at every fight.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>I’m a free agent. I haven’t allowed any promoters to have exclusive options on my fight. I don’t need a promoter.</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>I was painfully initiated into boxing because the guys I fought were much larger than me.</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Aaron Pryor wants to get into the ring with me. He wants to be able to retire, and he will, for health reasons.</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>When I turned pro, Muhammad Ali was laying back, and I was able to fill up an area that was empty.</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>I think an athlete should be honest. I know it’s difficult, but if a guy knocked me on my can, I couldn’t very well say, ‘I slipped.’</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Before the start of the ’76 Olympics, I’d had 160 amateur fights. I won 155 and lost five.</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Ali’s belief in himself was something I picked up on, and it’s become my own philosophy.</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>Holyfield is nothing but class, and I think he’s a breath of fresh air for the sport.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>Except for Ali, fighters had never been marketable.</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>Generally, the more weight you put on, the less effective you are.</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>Duran always disturbs me. The guy is just weird. Before our first fight, both Duran and his wife gave my wife the finger.</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>Although it was a great accomplishment to win a gold medal, as soon as they put it on you, your career is over.</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>They say that I’m stubborn, and my wife says that, too, but it’s paid off so far.</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>I run with music all the time. I cannot run without my iPod. If an Usher song comes on and it’s fast, I go fast.</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td>Boxing will always be in my life.</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>When we returned to the U.S., I wanted to kiss the ground after witnessing the hardships endured by people in other countries.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>There will always be something about two men in the ring roughly capturing that mystique because it’s pure man-to-man competition. Because of the rich history and tradition of boxing, it will always maintain that mystique.</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>At 14, I was the most disciplined guy around. I would get up at 5 o’clock in the morning and run five miles, and then go to school. Sometimes I would run behind the school bus, and the kids thought I was just crazy. I knew what I wanted.</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>I decided to turn pro, and I recall what Ali said to me: ‘Get Angelo Dundee. He’s the right complexion with the right connection.’ He knew boxing. Our relationship was genuine and sincere.</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>One of my fondest memories was the moment inside the Olympic arena when I was waiting under the stadium, and those majestic gates opened up. It was a whole other world.</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>I instantly connected with boxing. It became a significant part of me. I lived, slept, and ate boxing. It was a way for me to express myself because I wasn’t very outspoken.</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>The thing about boxers is that there’s respect there. You beat me, and though I might not like it, deep down inside, I respect you. It’s a code of honor.</td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td>I did not come from a middle-class family at all. I didn’t possess middle-class possessions, but my parents provided me with what was necessary for surviving in society.</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>While I didn’t excel highly in school, I felt that I was progressing – not just in boxing, but in life.</td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>Sugar Ray Robinson was probably the greatest pound-for-pound fighter of all time.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>I am excited to share my archive pictures and footage. I’ll also share announcements about current events and success stories from the Sugar Ray Leonard Foundation to help fight diabetes and child obesity.</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>I don’t hold any regrets whatsoever about my life besides hurting people I loved.</td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td>I always expect unexpected challenges. Boxing is not an easy sport.</td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td>Muhammad Ali was a god, an idol, and an icon. He was boxing. Any kid that had the opportunity to talk to Ali, to get advice from Muhammad Ali, was privileged. He’s always given me time to inquire, although I was in awe and didn’t ask questions.</td></tr><tr><td>54</td><td>I want my fights to be seen as plays that have a beginning, a middle, and an end.</td></tr><tr><td>55</td><td>You don’t heal easily unless you’re young.</td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td>You get these moments in the ring that live forever. That’s what Muhammad Ali accomplished, and I hope that I have as well.</td></tr><tr><td>57</td><td>I made mistakes, but I’m luckier than<br><i class=mdi-book-open-outline></i> Posted in <a href=# rel="category tag">Scoop</a> <a href=# rel=prev><span><i class=mdi-chevron-left></i>Prev</span>What is the Net Worth of a Patent?</a> <a href=# rel=next><span>Next<i class=mdi-chevron-right></i></span>Drake Faces $10M Lawsuit from Ghanaian Rapper Obrafour</a><h3 class=widget-title><span>Latest Posts</span></h3><a href=#><img alt="Flour Mills records 97% decline in profit, reaching N257m" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flour-Mills-of-Nigeria-Plc-150x150.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3><a href=#>Flour Mills records 97% decline in profit, reaching N257m</a></h3><i class=mdi-clock-time-three-outline></i>January 29, 2024 <a href=#><img alt="Osun Communities Clash Again, Forcing Residents to Flee" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/communal-clash-150x150.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3><a href=#>Osun Communities Clash Again, Forcing Residents to Flee</a></h3><i class=mdi-clock-time-three-outline></i>January 29, 2024 <a href=#><img alt="Engagement with Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger Welcomed by Nigerian Government" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nigerian-govt-open-for-engagement-with-Burkina-Faso-Mali-Niger-150x150.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3><a href=#>Engagement with Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger Welcomed by Nigerian Government</a></h3><i class=mdi-clock-time-three-outline></i>January 29, 2024 <a href=#><img alt="The Federal Government has instructed the contractor to return to the Eleme-Onne East-West road construction site" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Umahi-150x150.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3><a href=#>The Federal Government has instructed the contractor to return to the Eleme-Onne East-West road construction site</a></h3><i class=mdi-clock-time-three-outline></i>January 29, 2024 <a href=#><img alt="Dangote refinery to import crude from US&nbsp;" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Dangote-Refinery-150x150.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3><a href=#>Dangote refinery to import crude from US&nbsp;</a></h3><i class=mdi-clock-time-three-outline></i>January 29, 2024<h5><u>TRENDING</u></h5>© 2023 <a href=#>NewsNow Nigeria</a> NNNG Media Limited, Nigeria.<i class=mdi-chevron-up></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiqrp%2BRp3qzrdhmo56nnpa%2Fpb%2BMsJyapKSdfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsugar-ray-leonards-wealth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsugar-ray-leonards-wealth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsugar-ray-leonards-wealth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsugar-ray-leonards-wealth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsugar-ray-leonards-wealth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsugar-ray-leonards-wealth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./intels-discrete-gpu-era-begins-intel-launches-xe-max-for-entrylevel-laptops.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./intels-discrete-gpu-era-begins-intel-launches-xe-max-for-entrylevel-laptops.html>Xe MAX: Work Sharing &amp;amp;

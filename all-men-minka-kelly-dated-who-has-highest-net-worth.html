From A-list actors, dreamboat musicians, and even sporting legends, the actress has had her fair share of whirlwind romances. But who is the richest out of Kelly’s famous exes? Let’s take a look back at every actor, singer, and athlete that Kelly has been romantically involved with ranked by their impressive net worths.</p><h2 id=brian-j-white---1-5-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Brian J. White - $1.5 Million Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In eighth place, we have Emmy-nominated actor Brian J. White. With several acting credits to his name both in film and television, it’s no surprise that the Stomp The Yard star’s net worth reaches the million mark. According to Celebrity Net Worth, White’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth comes in at $1.5 million</a>. The love story between Kelly and White was a short one as the two only remained together for one year between 2003-2004. However White certainly found his happily ever after with his current wife, Paula Da Silva, who he married in 2010.</p><h2 id=donald-faison---12-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Donald Faison - $12 Million Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming in hot at number seven is Scrubs star, Donald Faison with an admirable $12 million net worth. Faison and Kelly dated in 2005, shortly after her split with White. However, the pair only dated for just under two years before calling it quits. Nowadays Faison remains married to his beloved wife CaCee Cobb. The pair tied the knot in 2012 and have been happily married ever since.</p><h2 id=jesse-williams---12-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jesse Williams - $12 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>In 2017, shortly after his divorce from his ex-wife Aryn Drake-Lee, Grey’s Anatomy star Jesse Williams began his brief whirlwind romance with Kelly. Amongst rumors that Kelly had been the reason behind Williams and Drake-Lee’s split, and the hostile custody battle that followed, it’s no surprise that Kelly and Williams’ relationship was short-lived. And so with a reported $12 million net worth, Williams takes the joint seventh spot on this list of exes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All Of Taylor Swift's Famous Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together</a></span></p><h2 id=wilmer-valderrama---20-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Wilmer Valderrama - $20 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>In sixth place with a $20 million net worth is That 70s Show star, Wilmer Valderrama. Valderrama and Kelly dated briefly in 2012 before deciding to split. However, in 2016 the pair seemed to give things a second chance as they were spotted together on a getaway to Cabo San Lucas.</p><h2 id=josh-radnor---30-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Josh Radnor - $30 Million Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Valderrama and Kelley’s relationship was also short-lived as in December of 2016 she began dating How I Met Your Mother star, Josh Radnor. However, with their relationship only lasting 4 months, it seems as though the pair of actors were perhaps less compatible than they would have wished. With a reported $30 million net worth, Radnor takes the fifth spot on the list.</p><h2 id=john-mayer---70-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>John Mayer - $70 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>With John Mayer’s reputation as one of the music industry’s most famous heartthrobs, it may not come as a surprise to hear about Kelly’s romance with the singer. The pair began dating in 2007 and engaged in a brief yet adorable relationship. During their relationship, the pair seemed to be attached at the hip as they were seen on walks, at basketball games, and even shopping together. However, according to Page Six, Mayer supposedly called it quits with Kelly in order to pursue Hollywood A-lister Jennifer Aniston. With an impressive $70 million net worth, Mayer comes in fourth, just missing out on being crowned part of the top three.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-evans---80-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Chris Evans - $80 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>In third place is Marvel star and leading Avenger Chris Evans. Page Six reports that the pair first began to spark rumors about their relationship in 2007 which unfortunately had to be called off due to conflicting work schedules. They tried again in 2012, giving their relationship a second chance which ultimately did not work out either. 3 years later in 2015, they were seen together again engaging in a cute couple's dog walk yet never confirmed the rumors of a reconciliation. Unsurprisingly, Evans ranks third on this list with his reported $80 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kate Beckinsale's Taste In Men Is Interesting...

However a year into their relationship the pair split due to alleged clashing working commitments and differing career paths. <a href=#>Most recently the pair were seen walking Kelly’s dog</a> together indicating the amicable terms of their breakup and maybe even a potential reconciliation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=derek-jeter---200-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Derek Jeter - $200 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>And finally, in first place with a jaw-dropping $200 million net worth is <a href=#>Yankees legend, Derek Jeter</a>. Perhaps one of her longest relationships to date, Kelly began dating Jeter in 2008. The pair remained together for several years and even began to spark wedding rumors a year before their breakup. Unfortunately, the pair called it quits in 2011. Whilst Jeter tied the knot with his current wife Hannah Jeter in 2016, Minka reportedly remains single.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>From Tana Mongeau To Jersey Shore's Vinny: Francesca Farago's Dating History</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpaRdorKvecyipaSZXaCyrbjYZpuarJWZeri0zmafmqtdnbaotMSsq2amlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-men-minka-kelly-dated-who-has-highest-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fall-men-minka-kelly-dated-who-has-highest-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fall-men-minka-kelly-dated-who-has-highest-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fall-men-minka-kelly-dated-who-has-highest-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-men-minka-kelly-dated-who-has-highest-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-men-minka-kelly-dated-who-has-highest-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sophia-martelly.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sophia-martelly.html>Sophia Martelly Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./241991-kate-middletons-mom-hints-grandkids-geor-html.html>Kate Middleton's Mom Hints at Grandkids George, Charlotte and Louis' Excitement over Santa's Visit</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./241991-kate-middletons-mom-hints-grandkids-geor-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

<time>26 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>The music industry, particularly in urban music, has provided a consistent string of freshman artists over the past few years.&nbsp;G Herbo, born Herbert Wright III, is one of those who rolled off the production line in 2014.</span></p><p><span>He’s released plenty of projects since hitting the scene and doesn’t look like he’ll be slowing down anytime soon.&nbsp;This rapper’s discography includes albums such as&nbsp;</span><span>Welcome to Fazoland,</span><span>&nbsp;2014;&nbsp;</span><span>Strictly 4 My Fans,</span><span>&nbsp;2016;&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Humble Beast,</span><span>&nbsp;2017.</span></p><h2><strong><span>G Herbo’s Biography, Age</span><br></strong></h2><p><span>Herbert Wright III was born in South Shore on the Southeast Side of Chicago on October 8, 1995.

Stone gang) and Muskegon Boyz (a faction of the Gangster Disciples).&nbsp;However, the initials NLMB also stand for “Never Leave My Brethren” for the Herbo NLMB fraternity.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Songs and Mixtapes</span></strong></h2><p><span>G Herbo and Lil Bibby got some well-deserved attention for their song&nbsp;</span><span>Kill the Shit</span><span>.&nbsp;The song has since been viewed over 15 million times and counts on YouTube.&nbsp;Even the famous Canadian animator, Drake, described them as the future.&nbsp;In February 2014, Lil Herb dropped&nbsp;</span><span>Back to Fazoland,</span><span>&nbsp;his debut mixtape which was dedicated to his friend Fazon Robinson.&nbsp;He was the first of Herb’s friends to lose their lives to gun violence.&nbsp;The project received many positive reviews, and Fader magazine praised Herbo’s rich content and lyrical dexterity.</span></p><p><span>Herb went on to feature on top hit songs like Nicki Minaj, Common and Chance The Rapper.&nbsp;In the same year of release, XXL Magazine chose him for their Show & Prove segment of the 2014 Freshmen Class issue.&nbsp;He also surprised his fans by releasing an unexpected second mixtape for 2014. It was titled&nbsp;</span><span>Project Pistol</span><span>&nbsp;P.</span></p><p><span>2015 was a very big year for the rapper, which kicked off with a report on chef Keef&nbsp;</span><span>Faneto’s remix.&nbsp;</span><span>It also involved fellow rappers King Louie and longtime friend Lil Bibby.&nbsp;Lil Herb proved to be a marketing genius when he wasn’t included in XXL’s 2015 promo, instead of reacting with a bang like most rappers would, he released a single titled&nbsp;</span><span>XXL</span><span>.&nbsp;The magazine praised the rapper and praised the song.&nbsp;Subsequently, he was included in the 2016 freshmen list.</span></p><p><span>Herb announced his third mixtape in August 2015 titled&nbsp;</span><span>Ballin Like I Am Kobe,</span><span>&nbsp;released in honor of his friend Jacobi Herring.&nbsp;In September of the same year, he signed with Cinematic Music Group and officially changed his stage name to G Herbo.&nbsp;</span><span>Ballin Like Me, I’m Kobe</span><span>&nbsp;was released under Cinematic on September 29 to critical acclaim and positive reviews.</span></p><p><span>He closed the year with a single titled&nbsp;</span><span>The Lord Knows,</span><span>&nbsp;for which he collaborated with Joey Bada$$, a rapper from New York.</span></p><p><span>On April 4 the following year, G Herbo met with SXSW where he announced the title of his debut album.&nbsp;He released a single in March titled&nbsp;</span><span>Yeah I Know.&nbsp;</span><span>Then two singles for the album in the middle of the year entitled&nbsp;</span><span>Remonter</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Drop.&nbsp;</span><span>On October 10, he released the music video on a fourth single.&nbsp;He also did a song with DJ Twin,&nbsp;</span><span>They Know Us</span><span>&nbsp;With Lil Bibby and Sean Kingston.</span></p><p><span>Since announcing his debut album&nbsp;</span><span>Humble Beast,</span><span>&nbsp;G Herbo was set to release a fourth mixtape,&nbsp;</span><span>Strictly 4 My Fans,</span><span>&nbsp;and an updated version of his debut mixtape&nbsp;</span><span>Welcome to Fazoland 1.5.&nbsp;</span><span>He also released singles&nbsp;</span><span>I Know, Red Snow, I Like Everything</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>4 Minutes From Hell, Pt.5.</span></p><h2><strong><span>G Herbo Girlfriend Gay Rumors Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Herb has been dating Ariana Fletcher since 2014.

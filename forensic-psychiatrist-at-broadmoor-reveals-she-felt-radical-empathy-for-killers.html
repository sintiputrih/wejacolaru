women would get solicitors to fight for their right to visit sex offenders with their own children in tow, and sent so many love letters to Sutcliffe that he couldn’t answer them all.&nbsp;</p><p

Peter Sutcliffe, who murdered 13 women and injured seven more in the 1970s</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Our job is not to dwell on what they’ve done in the past, it is to rehabilitate them,’ Professor Taylor says.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘People want contact with high profile patients, so I think it’s not any secret… that Peter Sutcliffe had a very big post bag.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It is claimed in the documentary that Sutcliffe received so many love letters from women that he didn’t have the time to respond to all of them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Not only that, but the serial killer, who died in November last year, also received three to four visits a week from young women – a different one every time.&nbsp;</p><p

letters were, I’d think they were written by someone quite young, in their 20s or 30s,’ he says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Someone who is very awkward with women who thought he could arouse them with writing these frothy 1950s, 1960s expressions like “supa-duppa” and “absolute bliss” and “how wonderful”.</p><img decoding=async id=i-f3d0b76c6206618b

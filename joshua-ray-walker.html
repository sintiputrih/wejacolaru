The first verse outlines the idea that if someone continues to drink despite the risks, they will eventually find themselves in trouble with the law. The line "this drinking will get the best of me" suggests that the singer is aware of the potential dangers but still chooses to indulge. The repetition of "once, twice, three strikes a felony" acts as a reminder of the severity of the situation.</p><br><p>The second verse tells the story of a reckless moment involving a car and a bottle of alcohol. The imagery used paints a vivid picture of the scene, with the car "wrapped" around a tree, and a bumper "lodged in that cop's windscreen." The tone of the verse suggests that while the situation is dangerous and potentially life-threatening, the singer still finds the situation somewhat amusing.</p><br><p>The final verse concludes the story by mentioning a female character that the singer is trying to impress. The line "they did not advise, but I've got gals to please" reveals that the singer is making poor decisions in order to impress someone else. The chorus is repeated again, reminding the listener of the potential consequences of reckless behavior.</p><br><p>Overall, the song serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of excessive drinking and the potential consequences of one's actions.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Cause it's once, twice, three strikes a felony</u><br>If I get caught drunk driving for a third time, I'll be charged with a felony</p><br><p><u>If I keep on messing around, this drinking will get the best of me</u><br>I'm worried that my heavy drinking will have negative consequences for me</p><br><p><u>Who knows if my luck runs out, I guess we'll have to wait and see</u><br>I can't predict what will happen to me as a result of my drinking;

<time>06 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Tyson Bagent and his girlfriend, Maggie Litzinger, have been dating for quite some time. Bagent’s girlfriend, Maggie, works as an ER nurse in Hagerstown, Maryland.</strong></p><p>Tyson and Maggie are said to have met in college. Maggie is a loving girlfriend who would be rooting for her partner from the front row, in addition to being a strong independent lady. Tyson Jacob Bagent, 23, is a quarterback for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.</p><p>Bagent began playing basketball in high school and was named West Virginia’s Gatorade Player of the Year. Despite his strong desire to attend Division I, he transferred to Shepheard University. Tyson’s dedication to his heritage also enabled him to achieve incredible success.</p><p>The quarterback smashed every positional record as well as several other divisional records during his five years at the university. After signing as a free agent, the undrafted Hardon Hill Trophy winner joins the Chicago Bears 2023 roster. When he advanced to the starting quarterback position from the third string, destiny intervened.</p><p>Tyson Bagent is someone we both professionally and personally know. Travis, his father, is a world arm-wrestling champion, and Casey, his mother, has a degree in sports marketing. Many fans are anxious about the young hunk’s love life as a result of his mainstream media appearance. We’re here to tell you that he’s not single. Maggie Litzinger is the rookie’s girlfriend. Furthermore, it is the kind of love that will almost certainly remain forever.</p><h2>Is Scott Frost Christian? Explore His Religion</h2><p>Maggie is probably in her early to mid-20s and is from Baltimore, Maryland, where she finished her education. In terms of schooling, she began her career as a nurse at South Carolina University. Maggie, on the other hand, had to return to WVU because to family obligations.</p><p>She studied public relations, communications, and health relations at West Virginia University. Her interest in medicine has also been a driving element in propelling her career forward. Maggie has been a nurse technician at Meritus Medical Center since 2017.</p><p>She began her career as a registered nurse at Meritus Health in 2022 and is now an emergency room nurse at MUSC. Maggie also enjoys traveling, shooting, and documenting her experiences. She also enjoys working out and thinks that it has radically changed her life.</p><h2>Meet His Wife Ashley Frost</h2><p>Keeping the couple’s relationship in mind, they most likely met while Tyson was still a student at Shepheard University. We have no idea when the couple began dating. We had to check at Maggie’s Instagram instead of Tyson’s because Tyson has a professional account. Maggie posted their first photo together in February 2023.</p><p>Even though no explicit assertions were made about their relationship, she did leave a cryptic message. In October, she did, however, confirm the couple’s long-term relationship. Maggie shared a series of photos of herself at a Bears game, cheering on her partner.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?

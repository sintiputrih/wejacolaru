Something getting delayed or cancelled. It is what it is,” said the stoic stalled traveler.</p><p>“The big point of New Year’s Eve is midnight, right?

Getting angry doesn’t help anything” he said.</p><p>The travel setbacks had other Phans bouncing round the room, however.</p><p>“They f—ed us,” Walter Sawyers bluntly stated.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">A sign at Penn Station on Dec. 31 with all of the trains experiencing delays. <span class=credit>John Roca</span></figure><p>The 26-year-old tile salesman and his buddy came from Baltimore to catch part of the jam band’s annual four-night New Year’s Eve run.</p><p>They were waiting out their second train delay, after rebooking this morning amid the backlog.</p><p>“F–k it.

It had already been delayed an hour, and they weren’t buying the new schedule time.</p><p>“A train just boarded that was scheduled for 6:00 a.m. We found a guy from Amtrak and said, ‘There’s no way this train leaves in ten minutes, right?’ He just shook his head and walked away. The train’s not leaving anytime soon,” Chrencik said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">NJ Transit also suspended trains on the corridor between Trenton and New York on Sunday. <span class=credit>John Roca</span></figure><p>“My problem is the lack of communication. When we showed up we didn’t see the train on the board, had no idea what was going on. Airlines are shitty, but at least when you’re at the airport, the airline is telling you everything.”</p><p>“You’d think a government-funded rail program would run better…actually, now that I say that out loud, maybe not.”</p><p>The delays came as one million people were expected in <a href=#>Times Square for the ball drop</a> — all of them encouraged to leave their cars at home and rely on mass transit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmbGlforK1vs5op56mnmLAta3ToqanZZOntrG8y56bZpqpYrumw4yynJqqo2Kyt7GMmqStqpGgeqWxy5qwrGc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tv-carpio-is-still-in-the-dark-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tv-carpio-is-still-in-the-dark-html.html>Spider-Mans Arachne, T.V.

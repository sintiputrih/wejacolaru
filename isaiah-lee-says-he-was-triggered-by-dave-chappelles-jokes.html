He also said he was in the process of trying to secure a place to live before he was nabbed in the Hollywood Bowl debacle.</p><p>Asked about reports that he suffers from mental health issues, Lee said they were “wrong” and “inaccurate.” His lawyer, however, has said he is receiving mental health services.</p><p>The viral incident <a href=#>has also led to more criminal charges</a> against Lee: He was charged on Thursday with stabbing his roommate last year. The victim in that case identified Lee as his alleged attacker when the Chappelle incident went viral, prosecutors said.</p><p>“It was pretty much done,” Lee said about his criminal case involving&nbsp;Chappelle.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Lee faces four misdemeanor counts related to his attack on Chappelle, as well as felony charges stemming from an incident in which he allegedly stabbed his roommate. <span class=credit>New York Post/David Buchan</span></figure><p>“But it went from me probably&nbsp;only doing six months [in jail] and having to do community service and living in a transitional home …&nbsp;to possibly 15 or more years in jail,” he added, shaking his head. “My son will be big by the time I get out.”</p><p>Still, he said he doesn’t regret what happened because he saw it as an opportunity to speak out about homelessness, LGBTQ rights and child sex abuse, topics that often serve as fodder for comedians.</p><p>Chappelle drew heat last year over his Netflix special “The Closer,” in which he jokes about transgender women, and defends controversial comments from <a href=#>author JK Rowling</a> and <a href=#>rapper DaBaby</a> about the gay and trans communities.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Chappelle came under fire last year for making jokes about transgender women. <span class=credit>Clint Brewer Photography/A.I.M /</span></figure><p>In the special, the outspoken comic cracks that he’s joining Rowling in “Team TERF” — the acronym for trans-exclusionary radical feminist — while slamming critics of DaBaby.</p><p>“A lot of the LGBTQ community doesn’t know DaBaby’s history. He’s a wild guy. He once shot a n—-r and killed him. In Walmart. Oh, this is true. Google it. Nothing bad happened to his career …,” Chappelle says.</p><p>He then quips, “Do you see where I’m going with this? In our country, you can shoot and kill a n—-r, but you better not hurt a gay person’s feelings!”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Lee said he did not regret getting on stage with Chappelle because he saw it as an opportunity to speak out. <span class=credit>ellis kaplan</span></figure><p>After the alleged attack, Lee said Chappelle asked him backstage at the Hollywood Bowl why he did it.</p><p>“I told him my mother and grandmother, who fought for his civil rights to be able to speak, would be upset at the things he said,” Lee recalled.</p><p>But Chappelle allegedly retorted, “Now your story will die with you, son.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Lee told Chappelle his mother and grandmother would be upset with the comedian’s jokes. <span class=credit>New York Post/David Buchan David</span></figure><p>“But he’s wrong,” Lee insisted to a Post reporter. “I’m sitting here talking to you about it.”</p><p>A rep for Chappelle did not return a request for comment.</p><p>A Netflix spokesman declined to comment on the record, and referred The Post to the company’s earlier statement:&nbsp;“We care deeply about the safety of creators and we strongly defend the right of stand-up comedians to perform on stage without fear of violence.”</p><p>Additional reporting by David Meyer</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j25ma2pfnsCitcChZKWdlWLAosXSZp%2BeZaeWwG7A0aKeoJ2imrFurthmm5qulWKwqa3PqZylpJWoequ7yp6qaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fisaiah-lee-says-he-was-triggered-by-dave-chappelles-jokes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fisaiah-lee-says-he-was-triggered-by-dave-chappelles-jokes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fisaiah-lee-says-he-was-triggered-by-dave-chappelles-jokes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fisaiah-lee-says-he-was-triggered-by-dave-chappelles-jokes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fisaiah-lee-says-he-was-triggered-by-dave-chappelles-jokes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fisaiah-lee-says-he-was-triggered-by-dave-chappelles-jokes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./john-krasinski-tall-height-compare-brothers-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./john-krasinski-tall-height-compare-brothers-html.html>John Krasinski Is Tall but His Height Can't Compare to His Brothers'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./denise-bidot-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-10946-html.html>Denise Bidot Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./denise-bidot-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-10946-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

She’s known as one of the greatest music legends to ever live, and while she was born in Brownsville, Tennessee, <a href=#>she lived in Switzerland</a> for over two decades. Ultimately, Turner gave up her U.S. citizenship to live abroad. Why did she do it? Here’s what to know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-did-tina-turner-leave-her-us-citizenship-behind>Why did Tina Turner leave her US citizenship behind?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tina-Turner-Switzerland.jpg><p id=par-2_97>Back in 2013, Tina Turner signed her “Statement of Voluntary Relinquishment of U.S. Citizenship under Section 349 (a)(1) of the INA” —&nbsp;the Immigration and Naturalization Act.” At 73 years old, Turner was ready to give up her U.S. citizenship to become a citizen of Switzerland. She had already lived in Switzerland with her second husband, <a href=#>German music producer Erwin Bach</a>, for about 20 years before taking the oath of Swiss nationality. Turner stated she no longer had ties to the U.S. “except for family, and has no plans to reside in the United States in the future.”</p><p id=par-3_33>While Turner didn’t formally “renounce” her U.S. citizenship, a source explained to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Washington Post</a> that she “took Swiss citizenship with the intent to lose her&nbsp;U.S. citizenship.” So, why did she do it?</p><p id=par-4_85>Turner found a lot of success in Europe. And because Bach also lived abroad, she didn’t find any reason to stay in the U.S. “I have left America because my success was in another country and my boyfriend was in another country,” Turner told Larry King in 1997, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the New York Post</a>. “Basically, Europe has been very supportive of my music. … My boyfriend moved there to run the company, and I always wanted to go to Switzerland and I was very happy.”</p><p id=par-5_18>While speaking to a local publication, Bach also said he and Turner felt “very comfortable” in Switzerland.</p><p id=par-6_31>Additionally, <a href=#>Turner and Bach</a> couldn’t purchase property in Switzerland without citizenship. There are strict restrictions for foreigners wanting to buy property. This served as an additional incentive for becoming a citizen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Her son, Ike Turner Jr., condemned her for moving away and not keeping up with her kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tina-Turner-kids.jpg><p id=par-7_53>It’s clear that Tina Turner adored Switzerland and never looked back after relinquishing her U.S. citizenship. But <a href=#>her son, Ike Turner Jr.</a>, publicly condemned her for her decision. He claimed he hadn’t talked to his mother since the year 2000 and she didn’t bother visiting her children in the U.S. after she moved.</p><p id=par-8_54>“Tina raised me from the age of 2. She’s the only mother I’ve ever known,” Ike Jr. told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Daily Mail</a> in 2018. “But I haven’t talked to my mother since God knows when – probably around 2000. I don’t think any of my brothers have talked to her in a long time either.”</p><p id=par-9_29>“My mother is living her life — she has a new husband and she’s in Europe,” he continued. “She doesn’t want to have anything to do with the past.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tina Turner died in Switzerland on Wednesday, May 24, 2023</h2><p id=par-10_19>Sadly, Tina Turner died on Wednesday, May 24, 2023. She was at her home in Küsnacht, Switzerland, near Zurich.</p><p id=par-11_74>“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Tina Turner,” a post on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> reads. “With her music and her boundless passion for life, she enchanted millions of fans around the world and inspired the stars of tomorrow. Today we say goodbye to a dear friend who leaves us all her greatest work: her music. All our heartfelt compassion goes out to her family. Tina, we will miss you dearly.”</p><p id=par-12_15>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqrrAZquuqp6av26%2BxKWgp6mlnsCpedSsZJyhpJ7HprrSoaCpZpipuq17</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftina-turner-relinquish-us-citizenship-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftina-turner-relinquish-us-citizenship-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftina-turner-relinquish-us-citizenship-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftina-turner-relinquish-us-citizenship-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftina-turner-relinquish-us-citizenship-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftina-turner-relinquish-us-citizenship-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jerry-schilling-obituary-news-death-news-trending.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jerry-schilling-obituary-news-death-news-trending.html>Why His Death News Trending?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-ode-to-a-koala-bear-by-paul-mccartney.html>The Meaning Behind The Song: Ode to a Koala Bear by Paul McCartney</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-ode-to-a-koala-bear-by-paul-mccartney.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

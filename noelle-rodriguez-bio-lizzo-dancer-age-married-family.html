Who is she? Where is she from? Is she married? Who are her family members?</p><p>Learn all about Noelle in this article.</p><h3><strong>Meet Noelle Rodriguez, Lizzo‚Äôs Former Dancer</strong></h3><p>Three former dancers who were a part of Lizzo‚Äôs dance squad are suing her on the grounds that they were harassed and worked in a hostile environment. Her production business Big Grrrl Big Touring, Inc. (BGBT), and a person referred to as the ‚Äúdance cast captain‚Äù are also named as defendants in the complaint, which was filed on Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by CNN through an attorney for the plaintiffs.</p><p>The Grammy winner was accused of weight-shaming by Noelle Rodriguez, <a href=#>Arianna Davis</a>, and <a href=#>Crystal Williams</a>, who also said they were coerced into touching a nudist at an Amsterdam strip club. The filing states that the trio also accuse the Truth Hurts hitmaker of allegedly ‚Äúinviting cast members to take turns touching the nude performers,‚Äù inside the club.</p><p>NBC News quotes Ron Zambrano, the three dancers‚Äô attorney, as saying, expressed, ‚ÄúThe stunning nature of how Lizzo and her management team treated their performers seems to go against everything Lizzo stands for publicly.‚Äù</p><p>He continued, ‚ÄúWhile privately she weight-shames her dancers and demeans them in ways that are not only illegal but absolutely demoralizing.‚Äù</p><p>The first to leave Lizzo‚Äôs squad was Crystal Williams. Noelle voiced her concerns to management on the choice to publicly fire Crystal after Lizzo assured them that she had ‚Äúeyes and ears everywhere.‚Äù She then complained about being insulted and made a resignation threat. Lizzo responded by telling her she was ‚Äúlucky.‚Äù According to the court filing, Lizzo gave Noelle the middle finger and uttered a racial epithet when she decided to resign.</p><p>Lizzo‚Äôs dance captain, Shirlene Quigley, is also facing a number of accusations.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‚ÄúIf they want to make an example of me, I will gladly be one. Hopefully, we can be an example of dedication, courage, and persistence under fire. I also hope to be an example of not toleration nonsense, too. It brings me peace to be at a point in my career where I can say NO to disrespect. I stand strong in walking away from spaces that don‚Äôt serve me, and more importantly, don‚Äôt deserve me.‚Äù</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Noelle continued, ‚ÄúMy talent, my character, and my reputation speak volumes on its own. Know your worth and never be afraid to use your voice. Stand up for what is right regardless of who is committing the wrong. Excited for what is to come. And to be honest it quite was‚Ä¶#aboutdamntime.‚Äù</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Noelle Rodriguez Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Noelle Rodriguez‚Äôs net worth is above $250 thousand.</p><p>Noelle starred in Lizzo‚Äôs music video for Rumors and was hired as a dancer by the singer. The dancer has a variety of past experiences to draw from, including dancing with Lizzo in the past and appearing as a background dancer in a moment from Euphoria‚Äôs first season.

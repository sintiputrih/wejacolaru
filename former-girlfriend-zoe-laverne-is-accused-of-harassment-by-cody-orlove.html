The original Tiktokroom later reposted a video of Orlove’s Instagram live rage over the incident.</strong></p><p>The TikToker stated LaVerne was allegedly disclosing his address and phone information in the video. He claimed that for months, Emma Throne, a fan of LaVerne, had harassed him and his family.</p><p>A few hours after the video went online, Orlove posted more information about the harassment in the comments section. He said that Thorne had dispatched police to both his home and the home of his girlfriend Tess Krauser.</p><p>He continued by adding that this had been going on for months and that he had no plans to post this until his mother called to inform him that a girl by the name of Indiana had been spamming them all day long and using really harsh language.</p><h2>Internet users believe Cody Orlove is lying about being harassed</h2><p>Unfortunately for Orlove, it appeared that not many readers were on his side in the comments area. Instead, they asserted that the TikToker was lying and using his ex-girlfriend as leverage.</p><p>“I feel as though I don’t trust him. He only makes sense when he brings up Zoe. She has a spouse and a baby, so she doesn’t have time for this, one person remarked.</p><p>“He employs Zoey when he needs relevancy. Man, move on. She has a kid and a husband. And did she not accuse you of harassing her?” said another user.</p><p>How does Zoey have your address, and how come from the first time your number did not change? was the third user’s inquiry in response to his assertions.</p><h2>Concerning Cody Orlove and Zoe LaVerne’s Questionable Past</h2><p>However, other individuals assumed Orlove was telling the truth and brought up their previous relationship with LaVerne.</p><p>They dated from 2017 to 2020, despite their relationship being filled with turbulence. They made the most of their connection by collaborating on YouTube channels, concerts, and retail promotions. even had a single released.</p><p>Although they declared their “amicable” breakup in June 2020, the truth was quite different.</p><p>Offline, LaVerne told her fans that Orlove had mistreated her; but, after the story went viral and was made public, she recanted and apologized for lying.</p><p>Days after LaVerne’s apologies, however, an audio recording surfaced in which it appeared that Orlove was forcibly holding LaVerne down while she yelled at him to “let go.”</p><p>Later, LaVerne admitted to being abused while live-streaming on Instagram. Orlove expressed regret for hurting his ex-girlfriend but insisted he never intended to be abusive or intrusive.</p><p>Instead, he said that they were in a toxic relationship as teenagers and occasionally went overboard.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/simon-sinek-motivating-speech-on-wife-relationship/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>social media personality</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Mia Jeal | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Mia Jeal was born on October 14, 2002, in the United Kingdom.

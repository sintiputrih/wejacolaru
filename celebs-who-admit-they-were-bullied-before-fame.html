An individual who is truly happy within themselves doesn’t&nbsp;use their energy to hate on another person. We can safely assume that whoever bullied the celebrities on this list probably feel very regretful now.</p><h2 id=jessica-alba><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jessica Alba</span></h2><p>Someone as gorgeous as <a href=#>Jessica Alba</a> has dealt with bullies in the past.&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She said</a>, "My dad had to walk me [to class] so I didn’t get attacked. I’d eat my lunch in the nurses’ office so I didn’t have to sit with the other girls. I’d get beaten up and picked on all the time. It was about being different and not fitting in. Apart from my being mixed race, my parents didn’t have money, so I never had cute clothes or a cool backpack." The fact that kids pick on other kids based on clothing and backpacks is so insane. It is so very sad that she had to go through that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-segel><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jason Segel</span></h2><p>Comedian <a href=#>Jason Segel</a> dealt with haters at a young age because of his size. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He said</a>, “I’ve been 6′ 4 since I was 12.&nbsp;I was 6′ 4, 100 lbs. I looked like Jack Skellington. Kids used to stand around me in a circle and one by one they would jump on my back and the rest would chant, ‘Ride the oaf! Ride the oaf!’ It’s true.” Being tall should never be an issue but during childhood days, it can be quite difficult to tower over everyone else.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lady Gaga</span></h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Daily News</a>, Lady Gaga faced a lot of criticism in her past. She said, “Being teased for being ugly, having a big nose, being annoying. ‘Your laugh is funny, you’re weird, why do you always sing, why are you so into theater, why do you do your makeup like that?’ … I used to be called a sh--, be called this, be called that, I didn’t even want to go to school sometimes.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Takeaways From Lady Gaga's Documentary 'Gaga: Five Foot Two'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lady Gaga is far from ugly and her love for theater is what led her down the path to success. Good thing she didn't listen to the haters. She has created such an amazing career for herself in the music industry.</p><h2 id=christian-bale><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Christian Bale</span></h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Music,</a><a href=#>Christian Bale</a> was bullied at the age of 13 when he first started acting in commercials. His classmates weren't a fan of his acting aspirations. He said, “It was not a great time.&nbsp;I was a victim of bullying and had other kids kicking and punching me every day. It was an early lesson in how making a film can set you apart. If you don’t want to live with the consequences then don’t make the film.” Thankfully, he kept acting regardless of the bullies who attacked him.</p><h2 id=blake-lively><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Blake Lively</span></h2><p><a href=#>Blake Lively</a> wrote in&nbsp;<a class=external-link title="(opens new window)" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an Instagram post</a>, "Kids used to make fun of me in elementary school by calling me Big Bird (because I was 'too tall' and had 'yellow' hair). Here’s to making best buddies with the things that once hurt you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Key Facts About Blake Lively's Early Career</a></span></p><p>These days her model-like height with those amazing long legs and her blonde hair filled with body & volume are things plenty of women wish they could have!</p><h2 id=priyanka-chopra-jonas><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Priyanka Chopra Jonas</span></h2><p>While she was in high school, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Priyanka Chopra Jonas</a> dealt with a mean girl who tried to turn her life upside down. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She explained</a>, "There was this girl who was a major bully. I think she didn't like me because her boyfriend liked me, or some high school dynamic. She made my life hell. She used to call me names and would push me against the locker." The bullying issues made Priyanka want to move back to India from the United States.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-fox><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Megan Fox</span></h2><p><a href=#>Megan Fox</a>, as beautiful as she is, dealt with bullying when she was a teen.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She said</a>, "There were some evil girls in my school and I went to Christian high school. I was 15 and everybody knew that my aspiration in life was to become an actress. One girl came to school on Halloween in a black leather catsuit and everyone thought she was Catwoman. She answered, ‘No I am Megan Fox.’ She was making fun of me. I didn’t say anything to her. I was really shy." The girls who bullied Megan Fox probably feel very stupid right now. They must have felt especially horrible after Megan Fox's debut in Transformers.</p><h2 id=henry-cavill><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Henry Cavill</span></h2><p>These days <a href=#>Henry Cavill</a> is known as the Man of Steel since playing Superman in DC's most recent movies. Back in the day, he had a very different nickname though. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He revealed</a>, "I was Fat Cavill. I bawled on the phone to my mom four times a day. My version of Superman is essential a guy who has spent his whole life alone." Wow! Well, he is no longer the type of guy living life alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kylie Jenner</span></h2><p>Kylie Jenner has been getting bullied since she was 9. That is such a young age to have people berating you and saying harmful things. She has blossomed into such a beautiful, hard-working, and impressive woman. She&nbsp;took to Snapchat to&nbsp;share a message with her fans. She said, "I think that I've done a really great job at handling all of this. But there are bullies everywhere. This isn't a pity party though ... This is so that others with bullies out there know that you're not alone." She is a wealthy and successful beauty so the haters really can't say much at this point.</p><h2 id=brittany-snow><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Brittany Snow</span></h2><p>Brittany Snow revealed,&nbsp;"When I was younger, I was bullied daily. I know what it's like to feel alone and outcast." (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.) Feeling alone and outcast is a terrible feeling but even someone as pretty as Brittany Snow has felt that way before. She was inspired by her experience getting bullied to start&nbsp;an organization called <a class=external-link title="(opens new window)" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love is Louder</a>&nbsp;which helps kids who facing depression and dealing with bullies.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Rock And Howard Stern Got Revenge On Their High School Bullies</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZJqcnZ7BbsDHnrBmr5Wnsm6u1KWjop2UYq%2Bmss6rnGaekaKycA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcelebs-who-admit-they-were-bullied-before-fame.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcelebs-who-admit-they-were-bullied-before-fame.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcelebs-who-admit-they-were-bullied-before-fame.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcelebs-who-admit-they-were-bullied-before-fame.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcelebs-who-admit-they-were-bullied-before-fame.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcelebs-who-admit-they-were-bullied-before-fame.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chocolate-brownie-cookies.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chocolate-brownie-cookies.html>Chocolate Brownie Cookies Modern Honey</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-baywatch-cast-david-charvet-quit-acting.html>This Baywatch Star Quit Acting For The Best Reason Ever</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-baywatch-cast-david-charvet-quit-acting.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

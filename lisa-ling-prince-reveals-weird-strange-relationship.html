The TV personality spoke about how the musician took a liking to her while she was a host on The View and their <a href=#>“weird” and “strange” relationship</a> that followed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=prince-was-a-big-fan-of-the-view-and-developed-a-liking-for-lisa-ling-so-he-reached-out-to-her>Prince Was A Big Fan Of The View And Developed A Liking For Lisa Ling, So He Reached Out To Her.</h2><p>Lisa was a regular co-host on The View back in the late ‘90s. She revealed to Jimmy Kimmel that Prince was a big fan of the show. Not only did Prince like the show, but she says that the singer developed a particular fondness for her, eventually reaching out on the phone.</p><p>"One day, our assistant gets a call from a man who says, 'Yes, he would like to speak with Ms. Ling.' And our assistant is, like, 'Who is he? What are you talking about,” Lisa said. “Finally he said, 'The artist formerly known as Prince would like to speak to Lisa.”</p><p>Luckily for Lisa, her assistant knew she was a big fan of the musician, and offered the star her phone number.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“He gets on the phone. I hear this voice, you know, this kind of soft voice, and it was him. I could tell clearly. He asked me if I wanted to go to the TLC concert with him,” she continued.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Haven’t Forgotten About The Time Justin Timberlake Dissed Prince On His Song</a></span></p><h2 id=lisa-ling-agreed-to-meet-prince-who-was-using-the-alias-karl-marx-and-the-two-stayed-up-all-night>Lisa Ling Agreed To Meet Prince, Who Was Using The Alias Karl Marx, And The Two Stayed Up All Night.</h2><p>After Lisa agreed to attend the TLC performance with Prince, he told her to come to his hotel and <a href=#>“ask for Karl Marx.”</a> While Prince certainly picked a unique alias, Lisa says it only got stranger from there.</p><p>Lisa said that she wasn’t worried about going to Prince’s room, as he had recently become a Jehovah's Witness, but she didn't expect the events that followed. Lisa said that the two stayed up all night talking about philosophy and engaging in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"incredibly serious discussions."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The next day, when she was back in her co-host chair at The View, she casually mentioned a man she had dated “a long time ago.” After the show, she explained that she received a call from Prince, who doesn’t usually call people himself.</p><p>She continued, “he said, 'Who were you talking about?' And I said, 'I was talking about someone in my past.'" Lisa said the singer got very curious, and asked, "Why were you talking about him?"</p><p>“As though we were, like, we had a relationship or something," she told Kimmel. And that was it, she said that he never called again. Prince might have been jealous, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but it wouldn't be long before he moved on.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Prince Had A Long History With Doves, And Here's Why</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoquRYrmqusZmp6uhnpiybr7Er5yapKNixKa10Z1krKyilruosYyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flisa-ling-prince-reveals-weird-strange-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flisa-ling-prince-reveals-weird-strange-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flisa-ling-prince-reveals-weird-strange-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flisa-ling-prince-reveals-weird-strange-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flisa-ling-prince-reveals-weird-strange-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flisa-ling-prince-reveals-weird-strange-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./theater-tiny-beautiful-things-won-me-over-against-my-will-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./theater-tiny-beautiful-things-won-me-over-against-my-will-html.html>Theater Review: Tiny Beautiful Things Won Me Over Against My Will</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jonathan-santucci.html>Jonathan Santucci | Fan Arch</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jonathan-santucci.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

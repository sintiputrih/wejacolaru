So that’s when I made all my friends, when I went golfing.”</p><p>“Off the court, they’ve been really good,” Lue said of Winslow’s acclimation. “On the court has been a little tougher, because guys are playing out of position. We got guys out, with no point guard and Marcus and Nico missing games, it’s just been tough.</p><p>“But they’re learning, every day, picking up things every single day, so just gotta continue to just keep getting better.”</p><p>Winslow’s long, winding route to L.A. has been littered with injuries, including one that required hip replacement surgery and others that included a sore left wrist and a back strain to a torn labrum in his right shoulder.</p><p>The Houston native arrived in the Clippers’ training camp feeling healthy, he said, and eager to help however necessary – whether that’s at center or point guard.</p><p>“I didn’t know he was as good a passer as he is,” Lue said before the Clippers’ fourth and final preseason game Monday at Ontario’s Toyota Arena. “I know he played a little point guard in Miami and with our point guard situation, with Jason (Preston) going down, he’ll be playing a little backup point, he been playing the four, he been playing the five. … so we just gotta keep learning the plays, different positions and I think he’s gonna be really good for us.”</p><p>Starting with a daily dose of morning inspiration.</p><p>About those, Winslow explained: “I just felt like with COVID and everything, we’ve kind of been through as a community, past two, year and a half, I just felt like myself included, but just the people in general just need it, need motivation, need positive things to look forward to, inspiration, motivation from our peers.</p><p>“So as much as I’m trying to spread it to other people and try to uplift them and help them push through, it’s also a good message for me,” he added. “To help me find that balance to start my day. It’s just been a hectic year and a half with the Black Lives Matter movement and COVID, going to the bubble, lot of people losing their jobs so just trying to spread some inspiration.”</p><h4>BEVERLEY’S EARLY IMPACT</h4><p>Former Clipper Patrick Beverley spent time pregame chatting with former teammates and Clippers staffers and officials – including embracing Lawrence Frank, the team’s president of basketball operations, in a warm hug.</p><p>Traded this offseason to the Minnesota Timberwolves, Beverley has made an early impression on his new team that isn’t unlike Winslow’s early messaging: positively inspiring.</p><p>“Unique thing about Pat is having been with him when he came into the league, he had that chip on his shoulder that’s kind of been everything that he is about,” T-Wolves coach Chris Finch said before tip-off on Monday.</p><p>“And he still has it as a vet who’s had quite a bit of success in the league for somebody who went undrafted, went to Europe and did all the things he had to go through to make it here in this league. So with that chip on his shoulder, people understand he’s a self-made NBA guy and that alone carries a lot of weight.”</p><h4>MORRIS OUT AGAIN</h4><p>Marcus Morris Sr. didn’t see the court this preseason. The 11th-year forward who’s had to deal with knee soreness recently wasn’t listed on the Clippers’ injury report Sunday, but the team held him out for the fourth exhibition game – to be cautious, Lue said.</p><p>“He’s doing good,” the coach said. “Just want to make sure he got some good practices in before we just threw him out there in the game, so, we got 10 days to practice and we’ll be able to try to get him going. So just want to be smart about it.”</p><p>Paul George also missed his second preseason game Monday, sitting to rest. Reggie Jackson also rested.</p><p>The Clippers started Ivica Zubac, Nicolas Batum, Terance Mann, Eric Bledsoe and Luke Kennard in their final preseason game before the regular season begins Oct. 21 at Golden State.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk6G2sbzEq6pmoqWowaq%2FxGauoqajoby4ecaeq62hnpx6oq%2FCpaCmmaSasW7AzmauopyVYr%2BiusaipaBloqS5pns%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fclippers-justise-winslow-getting-acclimated-to-wide-ranging-role.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fclippers-justise-winslow-getting-acclimated-to-wide-ranging-role.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fclippers-justise-winslow-getting-acclimated-to-wide-ranging-role.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fclippers-justise-winslow-getting-acclimated-to-wide-ranging-role.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fclippers-justise-winslow-getting-acclimated-to-wide-ranging-role.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fclippers-justise-winslow-getting-acclimated-to-wide-ranging-role.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./daryl-gurney.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./daryl-gurney.html>Daryl Gurney- Net Worth, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Ethnicity, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cardi-b-offset-astrology-love-compatibility.html>Cardi B &amp;amp; Offset's Astrology Proves They're Made For Each Other</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cardi-b-offset-astrology-love-compatibility.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

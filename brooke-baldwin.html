CNN’s Global staff has also shared a personal essay covering the story of COVID-19. She anchors the 2-4 p.m. edition of CNN Newsroom. Based in New York, she was recently diagnosed with coronavirus. </span>It took her a full two-week beating on her body. She went to some very dark places, mainly at night. Evenings bring on a weird sadness, which was individually odd for her.</p><p>However under the influence of the coronavirus, as each day came to a close, she often cried, unable to stave off the sense of dread and isolation. Baldwin stated the illness frequently brought her to tears. She even uploaded many pictures of herself during her self-isolation and sickness on social media handles. She remembers how bad she felt, physically, and emotionally. However, she is quite fine currently.</p><p>She remembers how she felt when the pandemic was first taking hold of the country and her beloved adopted hometown of New York City. She had a job to do. As a journalist, her focus and sense of purpose galvanized during times of pressure. She felt a deep responsibility to tell the stories of this pandemic, to connect with the viewers to show them the human faces facing this crisis right along with them.</p><p>In the few days, before she got sick, she even interviewed former Vice President Joe Biden. He talked about the urgency of flattening the curve. And also interviewed a woman named Michelle Bennett who had just said her last goodbyes through FaceTime to her COVID-infected mother.

She was too sick to even extend the Instagram series from her bedroom. She was suddenly cut off from her purpose, and even isolated from her husband, left to experience the virus firsthand all by herself. Like so many others.<br>she began sleeping in separate bedrooms and using separate bathrooms. Her husband did his best to care for her.&nbsp;Slowly, she started losing her taste ability.</p><p>On darker days, she didn’t want to talk to anyone. After days of trying to stay physically apart from her husband, it just became impossible. Her husband hated to see me suffer and he couldn’t take care of her. Even he started to hold her in those darker moments and let her cry, whispering: “Everything’s going to be all right.”&nbsp; These simple acts of connecting with her and hugging her were therapeutic beyond measure. She felt isolation might be worse than body aches. She endlessly feels grateful that she has a selfless husband who is also lucky enough to have remained well while she is ill.</p><p>Today, she truly considers herself one of the lucky ones. Her version of coronavirus did not take suffocating hold of her lungs the way it has with thousands of other patients. She never struggled to breathe. Even though her body constantly gave her the middle finger, her lungs did not. And most of all she is grateful for the reminders this virus provided to her. Firstly clarity comes from being quiet and listening to our feelings and second, the connection is more vital to our health and happiness than we might care to admit.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Talking about Brooke Baldwin’s career as a journalist.

Boxing is a great way for me to get out of my head and get out of my heart and just like sweat it out, honestly. I'm very serious about it. If I didn't have the insurance, I would honestly start sparring and start competing in boxing, because I'm that serious and love it. It's a huge passion of mine.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>2</td><td>My parents are very sensible and grounded, they take it with a pinch of salt. You know, I'm one of seven and they want success for all their children. They're proud but they're even more proud now that I've given them grandchildren.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>3</td><td>I've gravitated towards independent cinema because you have to work harder in studio scripts to flesh out characters, particularly female ones. They are not as sharply edged, they tend to be quite watery. They are not renderings of women as I know them.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>4</td><td>I'm not an attention seeker; I wasn't looking for fame and fortune. I wasn't sure while I was at college. But I found I was really comfortable taking on a different personality. It saved me from myself, in a way.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>5</td><td>[on giving up music and dancing] I don't regret it. I'm a jack-of-that-trade. There's not enough time, genuinely, not enough time in the day. So you choose your weapons. And the piano...I will not have time for the next decade until my children are grown! It's not about me anymore. It's not about myself. It's about them and the very little time I have left for me.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>6</td><td>I keep finding the most compelling characters in independent films. A lot of the roles in the other kinds of films were peripheral princesses or just boring, boring women - female characters that were utterly ordinary and devoid of any personality or spirituality. Is that a reflection of what we've become as women? That's something that we sometimes don't think about. You see all these stupid, materialist, horny, nympho characters that people put up there in movies, and you have to think: Is that what feminine dignity has come to?</td></tr><tr readability=6.7272727272727><td>7</td><td>[on directing] My big formative experience was <a href=#>Debra Granik</a>. That was school for me. It was the first time anyone had given me the responsibility of a protagonist, and to work so closely with her ethics and her tenets about her filmmaking, and her honesty. I was persuaded through the Deborah Granik School.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>8</td><td>My culture is very rich in the art; singing and dance were so much a part of my childhood. I was in a traveling professional dance troupe called Syzokryli, and I was very serious about the piano. So I was always performing.</td></tr><tr readability=6.3851351351351><td>9</td><td>[on <a href=#>Up in the Air</a> (2009)] <a href=#>Jason Reitman</a> sketches these characters and shines a real stark spotlight on them that illuminates all their foibles, all of their deficiencies, quirks, eccentricities and yet you still manage to root for them because their so human and complex. And I saw that in Alex.</td></tr><tr readability=8.7082294264339><td>10</td><td>[on any difficulties she encountered in casting <a href=#>Higher Ground</a> (2011)] It should have been a lot harder. I'd say, "It's about a woman enmeshed in this very particular spiritual community who's trying to conceptualize and define God for herself". And you use the word "God" and people quake with fear. That's when I started to realize what a touchy, bizarre, sensitive, combative subject matter it is.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>11</td><td>Doubt is the middle position between knowledge and ignorance. It encompasses cynicism but also genuine questioning.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>12</td><td>My dad is someone who feels the breath of God on his face.

I wanted to push both ways and try to come at it from a middle ground.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>14</td><td>What happened is that I ended up getting benched in soccer in high school so I tried out for the school play and I got the lead role. Then I just stuck with it.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>15</td><td>I just can't feel lukewarm about a character. I either despise her, admire her, or don't understand her and want to understand her.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>16</td><td>As an actor, you're sort of the court-appointed lawyer of the character. And that's what used to draw me to scripts -- something in a woman that I wanted to defend, something that I recognized or wanted to understand, something that turned my head. Now that I'm a mother, I think it's more the message of a film, or the questions that they pose about life -- that's the magnifying glass through which I look at them now. But at first it was all about the character.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>17</td><td>I'm not in this for the achievement. I'm in it for the illumination. That's how I choose my roles, that's how I attract roles -- it's a very spiritual process for me. And it's the only way I can continue, and stay interested. The acting ... it's really a vocation.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>18</td><td>There are some times when I think acting can be a noble profession.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>19</td><td>I really don't feel a need to be famous. But I do feel a need to make a difference, to shed light on human emotion through acting.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>20</td><td>It's terrifying to be the lead. There's a moment of excitement, and then pure terror.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>21</td><td>I can't do Los Angeles. I've always been the anti-Barbie. I don't want to be in a place where almost every woman walks around with puffy lips, little noses and breasts large enough to nourish a small country. As a kid I wanted attention, so I started praying for glasses because everyone had ace vision in my family.

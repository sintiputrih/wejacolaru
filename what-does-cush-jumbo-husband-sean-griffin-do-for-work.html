Their relationship and their high-profile lives have been kept on the down-low, as they enjoy keeping their lives as private as possible. <a href=#>Cush Jumbo makes it a point to avoid talking about her marriage and son</a> to the public. With a flashy lifestyle in the public eye, keeping her family close and out of the public eye is very important to Cush Jumbo and her family. Cush Jumbo has a very public career, while her husband, Sean Griffins, has a more typical career, and fans want to know more about their lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Celebs Have Been Saying About the Return of Broadway</a></span></p><p>The two started off as friends for years before ever dating.

They keep their relationship, and their son, Maximilian, out of the public eye. By the time she revealed that they were having a baby, she was already six months pregnant. The couple does take to Instagram to share special moments with their son, but he usually isn't in front of the camera when the paparazzi are around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Funny Girl’ Announces Complete Cast For Broadway Revival</a></span></p><h2 id=cush-jumbo-and-sean-griffins-married-on-stage><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Cush Jumbo And Sean Griffins Married On Stage</span></h2><p>On December 27, 2014, Cush Jumbo and Sean Griffin got married, but not in a very conventional setting.

nearby internet cafe, but it was a trap.</p><p>Unbeknown to Katie, Lynch had arranged for accomplice Stefan Sylvestre to wait outside her flat and throw sulphuric acid into her face.</p><p>Katie was

2020.</p><p>In November 2018 it was revealed that Lynch had been awarded nearly £200,000 of taxpayer's cash in legal aid.</p><p>On October 10, 2022, police announced they were urgently searching for Stefan Sylvestre, who is currently on the run after being recalled to prison for breaching the conditions of his licence.</p><p>A Probation Service spokesman said: “We are urgently working with the police to bring the offender back to prison where he’ll face longer behind bars.”</p><h2>What happened to Katie on Strictly?</h2><p>Katie was announced as the first official contestant on Strictly

best-selling international author, inspirational speaker, TV presenter and charity founder.</p><p>Since re-building her life after the attack, Katie established a charity, the Katie Piper Foundation, aimed at raising awareness of the plight of victims of burns and other disfigurement injuries.</p><p>In May 2018 Katie filmed Famous and Fighting Crime for Channel 4, a show in which celebrities get a taste of life as an emergency services worker.</p><p>Katie has also appeared on daytime favourites This Morning and Loose Women.</p><p>She also presented the Channel 4 show Bodyshockers and Never Seen a Doctor.</p><p>In April 2017, the inspirational star launched her own Channel 4 show called Face to Face, featuring other acid attack survivors and people with skin conditions.</p><p>In spring 2018, she toured the country with her theatre show What's In My Head to share her inspirational story.</p><p>She has written many books including Beautiful, Beautiful Ever After, Confidence, Things Get Better and From Mother to Daughter.</p><p>She was awarded an OBE in <a href=#>the Queen</a>'s New Year's Honours list in recognition of her services to charity and burns survivors.</p><p>Katie now has her own Breakfast show on ITV, which began on Sunday, August 6, 2022.</p><h2>Who is her husband and family?</h2><p>Katie Piper gave birth to <a href=#>her first child</a>, Belle Elizabeth, in March

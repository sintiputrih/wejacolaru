<time>23 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Eli Manning is a famous American footballer who plays for the New York Giants in the National Football League.&nbsp;He comes from a family where good football is part of his DNA.&nbsp;Eli is the son of Archie Manning, a former NFL quarterback and younger brother of Peyton Manning, who also played as a quarterback for the Denver Broncos.</span></p><p><span>The Mannings are among the popular names in American football not a single day goes by without being talked about.&nbsp;As we previously wrote, we talk about retired Peyton Manning, his family and his height.&nbsp;We will now focus on young Manning, who still plays football.&nbsp;In this article, you will learn all about Eli Manning’s family: wife, children, height, weight, net worth, salary and house.</span></p><h2><strong><span>General information about Eli Manning</span></strong></h2><p><span>Eli was born and named Elisha Nelson Manning IV on January 3, 1981 to Caucasian American parents named Archie Manning (father) and Olivia Williams Manning (mother).&nbsp;He was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America, where he also grew up.&nbsp;He is white and obviously identifies with the white ethnic group of America.</span></p><p><span>Growing up, the football star attended New Orleans (LA) Newman for high school and later went on to the University of Mississippi for college.&nbsp;From an early age, he showed an interest in football and played for his varsity team from 2000 to 2003. In 2004, he was chosen as the first overall pick in the NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers.&nbsp;He was immediately traded to the New York Giants, where he still plays today as an indispensable member of the successful football team.</span></p><p><span>With the Giants, Eli holds the record for most touchdown passes, most passing yards and completions in a career.&nbsp;He also holds the record for most touchdown passes in the fourth quarter of the season.&nbsp;Eli’s time with the New York Giants was not without trophies, leading them to victory in Super Bowls XLII and XLVI, where they beat the New England Patriots in both matches to emerge as champions.&nbsp;In each of those wins last season, he was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) and thus became one of five footballers to be named Super Bowl MVP.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family: wife, children</span></strong></h2><p><span>The celebrity footballer is happily married to college sweetheart Abby McGrew of Nashville, Tennessee.&nbsp;The two lovers tied the knot in a low-key wedding ceremony in San Jose del Cabo, Mexico on April 19, 2008.</span></p><p><span>Their union has since been blessed with the birth of three beautiful daughters namely;&nbsp;Ava Frances born March 26, 2011, Lucy Thomas, born June 17, 2013, and the youngest being Caroline Olivia, born January 29, 2015. During football season, the family resides at their home in Hoboken, New Jersey.</span></p><p><span>The family of five still lives together and there are no strong or weak rumors that the adults are thinking of separating.&nbsp;While they may have the typical issues of most male-female unions, they’re doing pretty well because it doesn’t make headlines and celebrity gossip.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body measurements: height, weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>Eli Manning stands at an impressive height of 6 feet 4 inches or 1.93 meters off the ground.&nbsp;His weight as an athlete is regulated at 67 kg while his height is usually set at 45 inches.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net worth, salary, house</span></strong></h2><p><span>Football in America is a very rewarding sport and Eli Manning has been well-regarded for his commitment and achievement in the sport.&nbsp;With an estimated annual salary of $18 million, his net worth is estimated at $115 million as of 2018, which puts him ahead of most other NFL players, who enjoy an excellent reputation in the sport..</span></p><p><span>Apart from his regular salaries as a footballer, he earns hugely from his myriad of endorsement deals, including his deals with Nike, Toyota Motor, DirecTV and Gatorade. With all that, his career earnings are the highest among the NFL’s most active players.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGidnJ56rq3Np6Cnn12stqexjJyfoqSUp7KvecWapKKkqWK1prXGoatmr5WetKnAjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIysmKWZoq56qbvUrJxo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feli-manning-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth-salary-house.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-pronounce-hijab.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-pronounce-hijab.html>How to pronounce hijab</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./denzel-washingtons-training-day-car-stolen-set-html.html>Denzel Washingtons Training Day Car Was Once Stolen From the Set</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./denzel-washingtons-training-day-car-stolen-set-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

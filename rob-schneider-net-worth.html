The first one was his Normany Manor House in San Marino, which he purchased back in 2003 for <strong>$1.922 million.</strong></p><p>The 4,690 square feet mansion features 4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, a nice spacious living room, and an outdoor pool.</p><p>What’s more, it is that once it even hosted the former president, Late Winston Churchill!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rob-schneider-house.jpg>However, the house was listed up for sale in 2009 for a price of <strong>$3.6 million.&nbsp;</strong>But, the house just could not be taken off the market for that price.<p>And in 2012, Schneider finally accepted <strong>$2.3 million</strong> for the house.</p><p>The other house he had was in Los Angeles. The house covering an area of 2,060&nbsp; square feet housed 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It was sold in 2004 for a price of <strong>$1.09 million</strong>, according to public records.</p><p>He also had another house in LA that got robbed in 2015. However, there aren’t that many details on the house at the moment.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Talking about cars, Rob has a really nice piece of machinery in his garage that surely turns heads while out on the street. If you’ve watched Duece Bigalow: Male Gigolo, you must be really familiar with this car.</p><p>Porsche Carerra Cabriolet, the very same that Rob drives in Deuce Bigalow, is his actual car. The car is pretty old now, but back in the day, it used to be quite the hotshot, and it used to cost over <strong>$60,000.</strong></p><p>Besides that, he probably also owns a Maserati. He, alongside the cast of Grown-Up, i.e., David Spade and Kevin James, was gifted a $200,000 Maserati by <a href=# rel=noopener>Adam Sandler</a>.</p><h2>Rob Schneider: Lifestyle & Vacations</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>The SNL star is leading a pretty calm lifestyle while taking care of his two daughters. But he’s not just limited to that. He has different hobbies, among which collecting items is one.</p><p>Apparently, he is an avid collector. Previously, his apartment would be surrounded by 1950’s rattan furniture, a tiki lamp, a pair of Eskimo snowshoes, treasured paintings, or just Hawaiian Shirts.</p><p>He was especially a huge collector of baseball cards. His collection had some of the rarest pieces that today could be well over <strong>$100,000!</strong></p><p>In 2015, one such card, the Bowman Card, was stolen from his apartment. The piece, in mint condition, was so rare that it alone was worth <strong>$175,000!</strong></p><p>Besides collecting, he is also an admirer of sports. He attended WWE’s Wrestlemania 21 in April 2005 and has even commented on a pro wrestling event.</p><p>Similarly, he is also a big fan of the <strong>San Francisco 49ers</strong> and even supports the Mexican soccer club Tigres.</p><p>Furthermore, he’s the kind of guy that loves to sit back and chill out. While in San Francisco, he can often be seen having lunch with old friends in corner delis.</p><p>Moreover, he’s often active in social media, posting photos of his sets or video cuts on Instagram. He is also a dedicated environmentalist.</p><h3>Vacations</h3><p>Of course, being in the line of work he is in, he’s traveled a lot. Mostly for work, but even so, he’s been to different parts of the world.</p><p>But it’s not just work calls that are usually important. He often spends time with his wife and daughters whenever he can.</p><p>In 2019, he posted a video sharing how he and his family had a lovely time in Mexico.</p><p>Besides that, he’s been to different exotic places, but there isn’t much information on the matter. He’s kept most of his vacations a bit private.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>The thing about Rob Schneider is that he’s really nice guy. It’s not just acting that he’s always been drawn to; he’s often considered about other’s lives too.</p><p>Through his numerous charities, he’s helped several organizations, and through it, he’s helped thousands of people.</p><p>The school system of his hometown had no music education programs due to a lack of funding. He founded his own foundation,<strong> The Rob Schneider Music Foundation</strong>, in 1996 in hopes of helping.</p><p>Through this organization, he encouraged and assisted music education for Junior High School Students. The foundations paid for teacher’s salaries and provided funds that covered the cost of instruments.</p><p>To date, he’s given more than $2 million to the program.

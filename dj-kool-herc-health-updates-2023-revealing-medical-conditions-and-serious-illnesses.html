<time>04 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong><a href=#>DJ Kool Herc</a></strong>, the legendary DJ who is widely regarded as the father of hip-hop, has been facing some serious health challenges in the past few years. In 2023, he was hospitalized for an undisclosed illness that required surgery and left him with a huge medical bill. His fans and fellow artists rallied to support him financially and emotionally, but his condition remains unclear. Here is everything we know about DJ Kool Herc’s health updates as of November 11, 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_DJ_Kool_Hercs_illness></span>What is DJ Kool Herc’s illness?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The exact nature of DJ Kool Herc’s illness has not been revealed to the public. According to some reports, he was suffering from kidney stones and needed an operation to remove them. However, this has not been confirmed by Herc or his family. Some sources also speculated that he might have diabetes or kidney failure, but these are also unverified claims.</p><p>The only thing that is certain is that Herc’s illness was serious enough to require hospitalization and surgery, and that he did not have health insurance to cover his expenses.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_his_Fans_and_Peers_help_him></span>How did his Fans and Peers help him?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When the news of DJ Kool Herc’s hospitalization broke out, many people in the hip-hop community and beyond expressed their concern and solidarity with the pioneer of the genre. Some of the most prominent figures in the music industry, such as Jay-Z, Eminem, Nas, and Diddy, donated money to help Herc pay for his medical bills.</p><p>Other artists, such as Chuck D, Q-Tip, and DJ Premier, used their platforms to raise awareness and urge people to support Herc. A website was also set up to collect donations and provide updates on Herc’s condition. According to the website, Herc was released from the hospital on February 28, 2023, and was recovering at home. However, he still needed ongoing treatment and medication, which meant that he still needed financial assistance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/What-is-DJ-Kool-Hercs-illness.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_is_DJ_Kool_Herc_doing_now></span>How is DJ Kool Herc doing now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of November 11, 2023, there has been no official update on DJ Kool Herc’s health status since his release from the hospital. However, there have been some positive signs that indicate that he is doing better. For instance, he made a rare public appearance at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony on November 4, 2023, where he received the Musical Influence honor for his contributions to hip-hop.</p><p>He was accompanied by his sister, Cindy Campbell, who organized the first party where Herc introduced his groundbreaking DJing techniques in 1973. Herc delivered a tearful speech, thanking his parents, his sister, and his fans, and saluting his musical influences, such as James Brown and Harry Belafonte. He also received a standing ovation from the audience, which included fellow inductees such as Missy Elliott, Kate Bush, and Chaka Khan.</p><p><strong>See Also:- <a href=#>Elizabeth Lynch Obituary & Cause Of Death: What Happened to Louisville, Kentucky Resident?</a></strong></p><p>Another encouraging sign is that Herc has been active on social media, posting photos and videos of himself and his friends, and promoting his upcoming events and projects. For example, on October 31, 2023, he shared a picture of himself dressed as a vampire for Halloween, with the caption “Happy Halloween from the Godfather of Hip Hop!”.</p><p>On November 9, 2023, he announced that he would be performing at a benefit concert for the Bronx Museum of the Arts on November 18, 2023, along with Grandmaster Flash and Grand Wizard Theodore. He also revealed that he was working on a documentary about his life and legacy, titled “The Man Who Created Hip Hop”, which is expected to be released in 2024.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_legacy_and_impact></span>His legacy and impact<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>DJ Kool Herc is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">widely recognized</a> as the originator of hip-hop, a genre that has become one of the most influential and popular forms of music and culture in the world. Herc’s innovation was to isolate and extend the break, the instrumental part of a song where the rhythm is most prominent, and mix it with another break from a different song, creating a continuous loop of beats that could be rapped over.</p><p>He also used two turntables, a mixer, and a sound system to manipulate the records and create various effects, such as scratching, cutting, and fading. He also introduced the concept of the MC, the master of ceremonies, who would hype up the crowd, shout out the names of the dancers, and rhyme over the beats. Herc’s style of DJing and MCing inspired countless artists and genres, such as rap, breakdance, graffiti, and sampling.</p><p>Herc’s influence can be seen and heard in many aspects of hip-hop and beyond. Some of the most iconic songs in hip-hop history, such as “The Message” by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, “Rapper’s Delight” by The Sugarhill Gang, and “Planet Rock” by Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force, sampled or referenced Herc’s breaks and beats. Herc’s parties and events, such as the Herculoids, the Universal Zulu Nation, and the Bronx River Jam, were the breeding grounds for the development and dissemination of hip-hop culture and values, such as peace, love, unity, and having fun. Herc’s legacy has also been honored and celebrated in various ways, such as documentaries, books, awards, and street names. In 2016, 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, the building where Herc threw his first party, was declared a New York City landmark.</p><p>DJ Kool Herc is not only a musical innovator, but also a cultural icon and a living legend. His health updates are important not only for his fans and peers, but also for the history and future of hip-hop. We hope that he continues to recover and thrive, and that he receives the recognition and respect that he deserves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhom6Nlm6S8rXnHnqmcZZiarq3Ax2asqZyRqbK0eZFpaWxloprDpq3LoqWgZZ2asaqvwKVknKeemba1tc6nqmaZnpl6tLHRoqauq12eua26xKyqnqtf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdj-kool-herc-health-updates-2023-revealing-medical-conditions-and-serious-illnesses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdj-kool-herc-health-updates-2023-revealing-medical-conditions-and-serious-illnesses.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdj-kool-herc-health-updates-2023-revealing-medical-conditions-and-serious-illnesses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdj-kool-herc-health-updates-2023-revealing-medical-conditions-and-serious-illnesses.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdj-kool-herc-health-updates-2023-revealing-medical-conditions-and-serious-illnesses.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdj-kool-herc-health-updates-2023-revealing-medical-conditions-and-serious-illnesses.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rob-hughes-kmbc-height-age-who-wife-biography-wiki-net-worth-18919-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rob-hughes-kmbc-height-age-who-wife-biography-wiki-net-worth-18919-html.html>Rob Hughes KMBC Height, Age, Who, Wife, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kyrie-barnes-corn-kid-obituary-7-year-old-shot-to-death.html>Kyrie Barnes Corn Kid Obituary: 7 Year Old Shot To Death</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kyrie-barnes-corn-kid-obituary-7-year-old-shot-to-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

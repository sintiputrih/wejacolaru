He’s an extremely wealthy man. And good luck to him, he’s worked hard. He made this network No. 1. However, when a new regime comes into a company they sweep clean.”</p><p>Osbourne noted that people at CBS were scared of losing their jobs due to Moonves’ sexual assault claims followed by his firing because getting rid of a CEO usually means there’ll be a new team ushered in to steer the boat.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Look Inside The ‘Big Brother 23’ House Has Twitter Fans Pointing Out A Health Violation</a></span></p><p>It would have been pretty hypocritical for Chen to weigh in on matters concerning the #MeToo movement when she was clearly standing by her husband, despite the dozens of allegations made against him.</p><p>An investigation performed by CBS clearly indicated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moonves’ behavior around his colleagues was inappropriate</a>, to say the least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite all, Chen is still actively working in Hollywood. She left her role at The Talk but was sure to stay on board to continue hosting Big Brother — a position she has held since the start of the program back in 2000.</p><p>Additionally, Chen has also hosted the celebrity edition, which ran between 2018 to 2019. She’s also a recurring co-host on Entertainment Tonight, so to say that Chen isn’t staying busy and working because of her husband would be a lie.</p><p>With that said, however, that doesn’t mean her career hasn’t taken a huge hit because of her decision to stick by her man.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Are The 10 Longest-Running Reality TV Hosts (On A Single Show)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s believed that Moonves has a $700 million fortune to his name, and though he was CEO at CBS, his investments alone will continue to generate him millions of dollars per year.</p><p>Moonves is a businessman with side projects in social media, entertainment, and technology, so while his public reputation may be ruined, that’s not to say that he won’t continue making enough money to carry on living his luxurious lifestyle in Los Angeles.</p><p>Moonves and Chen own multiple homes in LA, including a $28.8 million oceanfront mansion, an estate in Beverly Hills worth $20 million, and a Park Avenue apartment for another $10 million.</p><p>Are you surprised that Chen stuck by her (very wealthy) husband?</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julie Chen Revealed This One Thing About Her Past</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brbUpaCeZZOdsq95wJ%2BrnqpdobKiwsinnmasmJp6ta3LpGSwoJmhsm6wxJ%2Bcp5yZo7RutMSrZJ2ho5y%2Foq%2FEnWShraOXrq%2BwjKWcrGWdpLyvwsSsZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-julie-chen-after-leaving-the-talk-while-defending-her-disgraced-husband-les-moonves.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-julie-chen-after-leaving-the-talk-while-defending-her-disgraced-husband-les-moonves.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-julie-chen-after-leaving-the-talk-while-defending-her-disgraced-husband-les-moonves.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-julie-chen-after-leaving-the-talk-while-defending-her-disgraced-husband-les-moonves.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-julie-chen-after-leaving-the-talk-while-defending-her-disgraced-husband-les-moonves.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-julie-chen-after-leaving-the-talk-while-defending-her-disgraced-husband-les-moonves.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-was-kanan-jarrus-in-star-wars.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-was-kanan-jarrus-in-star-wars.html>Who was Kanan Jarrus in Star Wars?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./marielena-davila.html>Marielena Davila</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./marielena-davila.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

He was 18 years old on his voyage, making him the youngest and first teenager to fly to space.</p><p>Daemen is well-known for going to space with <strong>Amazon CEO</strong> J<strong>eff Bezos</strong> and his brother <strong>Mark Bezos </strong>after winning a <strong>$28 million</strong> auction ticket.
